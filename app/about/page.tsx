              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                Toronto Cupcake was created by Michelle Harrison to pursue her love of baking. Inspired by her mother,
                Michelle opened Toronto Cupcake in August 2010 as one of Canada's first gourmet cupcakeries.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                With a passion for creating delicious treats and an eye for beautiful designs, Michelle has grown
                Toronto Cupcake from a small bakery into one of the GTA's most beloved cupcake destinations. Her
                commitment to quality ingredients and exceptional taste has made Toronto Cupcake a staple for
                celebrations across the city.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
                Every cupcake is still made with the same care and attention to detail that Michelle brought to her very
                first batch. It's this dedication to quality that keeps our customers coming back for more.
              </p>
